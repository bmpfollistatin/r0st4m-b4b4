Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3.

Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.

    exerciseTips:
      "1.  As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\n2. You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\n3. Dumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (<strong>Note:</strong> For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\n4. Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.",

Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders.\n3. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.\n4. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box.

Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position.

      "1. To deadlift with short bands, simply loop them over the bar before you start, and step into them to set up. For long bands, they will need to be anchored to a secure base, such as heavy dumbbells or a rack.\nApproach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Ensure that the bands are under the back half of your foot (for short bands), directly where you are driving into the floor. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets.2. With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.\n2. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.",

This will be your starting position.\n2. Squat down by bending at your knees and lower the dumbbell between your knees, keeping your arm straight and your shoulder over the dumbbell. Pull the dumbbell up by extending the hips and knees. Shrug your shoulders and pull the dumbbell upward with your arm, allowing your elbow to pull up to the side.\n3. Aggressively pull your body under the dumbbell, catching the dumbbell with your arm extended overhead while moving into a squat position. The crease of your hips should be lower than the height of your knees. The movement is completed by standing up to full hip and knee extension with the weight held overhead. Bring the dumbbell back down to the starting position. This is one rep.\n4. Complete for the recommended number of repetitions before switching sides.",

      "1. Stand up straight with a flat bench behind you while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).\n2. Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. <strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.\n3. Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. <strong>Tip:</strong> If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n4. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",
    exerciseTips:
      "1.  As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\n2. You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\n3. You can also use a barbell for this exercise. Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.",

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\n2. Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (<strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n4. Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you touch the bench with your glutes. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. <strong>Tip:</strong> If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

Now hang with your arms fully extended and stick your chest out and lean back. <strong>Tip:</strong> You will be leaning back throughout the entire movement. This will be your starting position.\n3. Start pulling yourself towards the bar with your spine arched throughout the movement and your head leaning back as far away from the bar as possible. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. <strong>Tip:</strong> At the upper end of the movement, your hips and legs will be at about a 45-degree angle to the floor.\n4. Keep pulling until your collarbone passes the bar and your lower chest or sternum area touches it. Hold that contraction for a second. <strong>Tip:</strong> By the time you've completed this portion of the movement; your head will be parallel to the floor.\n5.

    exerciseTips:
      "1.  You can perform this movement using a chin-assist machine if unable to do it without aid or have a spotter help you up. You can also use the pull-down machine instead even though due to the fact that the pull-down machine does not involve a lot of the stabilizer muscles needed for the chin-up, the exercise becomes less effective. Also, as you get more advanced, you can use a weight belt to increase resistance.",

Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.\n2. Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position.\n3.

(<strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n2. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.\n3. As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.\n4. Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.",

      "1. This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n2. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart. Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (<strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n4. Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. <strong>Tip:</strong> If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n6.

    exerciseTips:
      "1. </strong>\n2. As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\n3. You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\n4. Dumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (<strong>Note:</strong> For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\n5. Another way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs. This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems. The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria. The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other. If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform.\n6. Finally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.",

      "1. Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in one hand resting on top of your thigh. The palm of your hand with the dumbbell in it should be at a neutral grip.\n2. By using your thighs to help you get the dumbbell up, clean the dumbbell so that you can hold it in front of you with your lifting arm being fully extended. Remember to maintain a neutral grip with this exercise. Your non lifting hand should be to the side holding the flat bench for better support. This will be your starting position.\n3. Your arm with the weight should have a slight bend on your elbow in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon. Begin by lowering your arm with the weight in it out in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep in mind that throughout the movement, your lifting arm should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.\n4. Return your lifting arm back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.\n5. Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n6. Switch arms and repeat the exercise.",

When your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement.\n8. As the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar.\n9. Continue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. <strong>Tip:</strong> Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.\n10. After the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar.\n11. Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position.\n12. Once the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles.\n13. Catch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement.\n14. Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.\n15. Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.\n16. Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs.\n17. Squat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor.\n18. Start over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wide for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings.\n3. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips as much as possible. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Lower bar position necessitates a greater torso lean to keep the bar over the heels. Continue until you break parallel, which is defined as the crease of the hip being in line with the top of the knee.\n4.

Now repeat the same movements as described above except this time your torso will remain straight as you go up and the bar will touch the back of the neck instead of the upper chest. <strong>Tip:</strong> Use the head to lean forward slightly as it will help you properly execute this portion of the exercise.\n6. Once you have lowered yourself back down to the starting position, repeat the exercise for the prescribed amount of repetitions in your program.",

It is necessary to learn the basics of skating including turning and stopping and to wear protective gear to avoid possible injury.\n2. You can skate at a comfortable pace for 30 minutes straight. If you want a cardio challenge, do interval skating â€“ speed skate two minutes of every five minutes, using the remaining three minutes to recover. A 150 lb person will typically burn about 175 calories in 30 minutes skating at a comfortable pace, similar to brisk walking.",

Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. <strong>Tip:</strong> For better range of motion you may also place the ball of your feet on a wooden block but be careful as this option requires more balance and a sturdy block.\n4. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time.

Allow your elbows to point out. This is your starting position.\n3. Keeping the upper arms stationary, slowly move the dumbbells in and down in a semi circular motion until they touch the upper chest while inhaling. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times and do not move the upper arms nor rest the dumbbells on the chest.\n4. As you breathe out, move the dumbbells up using your triceps and the same semi-circular motion but in reverse. Attempt to keep the dumbbells together as they move up. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down again slowly again. <strong>Tip:</strong> It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\n5. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.",
    exerciseTips:
      "1.  When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.\n2. Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.",

Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor. Make sure to keep your head up. Your upper arms should be close to your torso and parallel to the floor. Your forearms should be pointed towards the floor as you hold the weights. There should be a 90-degree angle formed between your forearm and upper arm. This is your starting position.\n2. Now, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and use your triceps to lift the weights until the arm is fully extended. Focus on moving the forearm.\n3. After a brief pause at the top contraction, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.\n4. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",
    exerciseTips:
      "1.  This exercise can be executed also one arm at a time much like the one arm rows are performed.\n2. Also, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a low pulley handle instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case, the palms should be facing up (supinated grip) as opposed to the torso (neutral grip).",

Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (<strong>Note</strong>: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n4. Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. <strong>Tip:</strong> If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the ball of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",
    exerciseTips:
      "1.  This exercise is not to be taken lightly as you are applying a lot of pressure to your arms when lifting the barbell. It is always a good idea to have a spotter as they can help you keep proper form. Also, make sure that your back is kept straight as bending it can cause an injury.",

      "1. Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.\n2. Make sure the palms of the hands are facing each other. This will be your starting position.\n3. While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Your wrist should rotate so that you have a supinated (palms up) grip. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.\n4. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.\n5. Now during the contracted position, rotate your wrist until you now have a pronated (palms facing down) grip with the thumb at a higher position than the pinky.\n6. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back down using the pronated grip.\n7. As the dumbbells close your thighs, start rotating the wrist so that you go back to a neutral (palms facing your body) grip.\n8. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

As you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbells keeping the palms down until your upper arm is extended and your biceps are fully stretched.\n3.
